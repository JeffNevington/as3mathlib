#summary Main page for as3mathlib

= Introduction =

The as3mathlib is intended to provide rudimentary numerical analysis tools for the Actionscript/Flex programming environment.

It is based off of the WIS Actionscript 2 libraries, which are still [http://members.shaw.ca/flashprogramming/wisASLibrary/wis/index.html available]

== Details ==

Library includes support for 
  * Geometric Objects and Intersection calculations
  * Integral and Differential equation calculations
  * Bezier, Quadric, Polynomial, Complex, Vector and Matrix calculations
  * Symbolic expression parsing


== Status ==


== Goals ==
This library intends to provide a correct and modular set of mathematical objects and routines.

Our primary goals are 
  * Correctness: the library is accompanied by a complete set of regression tests.
  * Clarity of code: the routines are well commented and follow best software engineering practices
  * Modularity: 
  * Flexibility: 
 Actionscript will never be a premiere high-performance computing environment.  Any heavy lifting will have to be done server-side or by a more performant daemon process.  This library will target calculations of modest scope and prototyping applications.
